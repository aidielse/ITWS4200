This lab had me make a git repository for my classwork and for my group project. 

The relevant information is in the lab3.txt file. 

This data is secure because the only location with this information is my git repository and my repository is private (and only shared with Prof. Plotka)

All of my group mates have the information that is listed under the group section in lab3.txt.
