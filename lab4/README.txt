Twitch Ticker - By Aaron Sedlacek

This webapp pulls it's data from the Twitch API, parses it, and displays it accordingly on the main screen.

The point of this web application is:

	1. to show the top 5 most watched video games being streamed on twitch
	2. to show how many people are watching the video game being streamed
	3. to show the number of channels available for a particular game

I utilized CSS event listeners to re-arrange the page when it is viewed by a tablet or mobile device.

I also utilized JQuery Mobile for the header, body, and footer of the page.

Installation Instructions:

	1. Download the entire folder
	2. Open index.html in your browser.

Other: 

	This app was developed solely for Safari Web Browser, It is untested in any other browser.

	Please note that there are SOP (Same Origin Policy) problems when the application is opened in any browser (except Safari) from a local file.

	It is reccomended to set up a virtual host to serve this application in order to solve the SOP problems, Or just use Safari to open index.html
